.Sh NAME
.Nm stdc_bit_flooruc ,
.Nm stdc_bit_floorus ,
.Nm stdc_bit_floorui ,
.Nm stdc_bit_floorul ,
.Nm stdc_bit_floorull ,
.Nm stdc_bit_floor
.Nd bit floor functions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdbit.h
.Ft unsigned char
.Fn stdc_bit_flooruc "unsigned char x"
.Ft unsigned short
.Fn stdc_bit_floorus "unsigned short x"
.Ft unsigned int
.Fn stdc_bit_floorui "unsigned int x"
.Ft unsigned long
.Fn stdc_bit_floorul "unsigned long x"
.Ft unsigned long long
.Fn stdc_bit_floorull "unsigned long long x"
.Ft generic_value_type
.Fn stdc_bit_floor "generic_value_type x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn stdc_bit_flooruc ,
.Fn stdc_bit_floorus ,
.Fn stdc_bit_floorui ,
.Fn stdc_bit_floorul ,
and
.Fn stdc_bit_floorull
functions compute the largest value with only a single bit set
that is not larger than
.Fa x .
The
.Fn stdc_bit_floor
function is a type-generic macro that expands
to one of the functions mentioned depending on the argument type.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The functions return the computed value mentioned in the description
if x is not 0, if x is 0 they return 0.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr stdbit 3 
.Sh STANDARDS
The stdc_bit_floor functions conforms to
.St -isoC-2023 .
.Sh HISTORY
The stdc_bit_floor functions were introduced in
.Nx 11 .
